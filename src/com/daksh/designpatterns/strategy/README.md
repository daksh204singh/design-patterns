# Strategy 

##### Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

###  Useful:
* When you want to define a class that will have one behavior that is similar to other behaviors in a list.
* When you need to use one of several behaviors dynamically.
* Often reduces long lists of conditionals.
* Avoids duplicate code by programming to an interface, and swapping implementations according to requirement.
* Keeps class changes from forcing other classes changes.
* Can hide complicated/secret code from user.

### Examples included:
* Duck
* Image Storage
* Encryption
